# Longest Substring Without Duplication

Write a function that takes in a string and returns its longest substring without duplicate characters.

You can assume that there will only be one longest substring without duplication.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
string = "kilimandjaro"
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
"limandj"
```

## Optimal Time & Space Complexity

`O(n)` time | `O(min(n, a))` space - where `n` is the length of the input string and `a` is the length of the character alphabet represented in the input string.
