# Longest Palindromic Substring

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

You can assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
string = "abaxyzzyxf"
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
"xyzzyx"
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

`O(n^2)` time | `O(n)` space - where `n` is the length of the input string.
