# Palindrome Check

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

## Sample Input

```plaintext
string = "abcdcba"
```

## Sample Output

```plaintext
true // it's written the same forward and backward.
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity

`O(n)` time | `O(1)` space - where `n` is the length of the input string.
