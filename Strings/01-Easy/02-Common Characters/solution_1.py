                                    Common Characters

Write a function that takes in a non-empty list of non-empty strings and returns a list of characters that are common
to all strings in the list, ignoring multiplicity.

Note that the strings are not guaranteed to only contain alphanumeric characters. The list you return can be in any order.


## Sample Input:

```
strings = ["abc", "bcd", "cbaccd"]
```

## Sample Output:

```
["b", "c"] // The characters could be ordered differently.
```

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity:

```
`O(n * m)` time | `O(m)` space - where `n` is the number of strings, and `m` is the length of the longest string.
```

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * m)**:  
  - `n` is the number of strings.
  - `m` is the length of the longest string.
  - Each string is iterated over and processed, resulting in this complexity.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(c)**:  
  - `c` is the number of unique characters across all strings. 
  - Space is used to store the `character_counts` dictionary.

"""

# Code Explanation:

"""

This function, `common_characters`, identifies characters that are common across all strings in the input list.
Let's break it down step by step:

### Code Breakdown
#### 1. **Initialization**:
```
character_counts = {}
```
This dictionary keeps track of how many strings each character appears in.

---

#### 2. **Iterate Through the Strings**:
```
for string in strings:
    unique_string_characters = set(string)
```
- Each string is processed one at a time.
- **`set(string)`** ensures only unique characters from the current string are considered. This avoids counting
duplicate characters in a single string.

---

#### 3. **Update Character Counts**:
```
for character in unique_string_characters:
    if character not in character_counts:
        character_counts[character] = 0
    character_counts[character] += 1
```
- For each unique character in the current string:
  - If the character is not already in `character_counts`, initialize its count to `0`.
  - Increment the count to indicate that this character appears in the current string.

At the end of this loop, `character_counts` contains a mapping of each character to the number of strings in which it appears.

---

#### 4. **Filter Common Characters**:
```
final_characters = []
for character, count in character_counts.items():
    if count == len(strings):
        final_characters.append(character)
```
- The function loops through the `character_counts` dictionary.
- If a character's count equals the total number of strings (`len(strings)`), it means the character is present in every string.
- Such characters are added to the `final_characters` list.

---

#### 5. **Return the Result**:
```
return final_characters
```
The `final_characters` list, containing the common characters, is returned.

---

### Example Walkthroughs

#### Example 1:
```
print(common_characters(["abc", "bcd", "cbad"]))  # Output: ['b', 'c']
```
1. **Unique Characters**:
   - `"abc"` → `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`
   - `"bcd"` → `{'b', 'c', 'd'}`
   - `"cbad"` → `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`

2. **Character Counts**:
   - `'a': 2`, `'b': 3`, `'c': 3`, `'d': 2`

3. **Final Characters**:
   - Only `'b'` and `'c'` have a count of `3` (equal to the number of strings), so they are returned.

---

#### Example 2:
```
print(common_characters(["a", "b", "c"]))  # Output: []
```
- Each string has only one unique character.
- No character is common across all strings, so the output is an empty list.

---

#### Example 3:
```
print(common_characters(["aaaa", "a"]))  # Output: ['a']
```
- `"aaaa"` → `{'a'}`
- `"a"` → `{'a'}`
- `'a': 2` (matches the number of strings), so `'a'` is returned.

---

#### Example 4:
```
print(common_characters(["*abc!d", "de!f*", "**!!!****d*****"]))  # Output: ['d', '!', '*']
```
1. **Unique Characters**:
   - `"*abc!d"` → `{'*', 'a', 'b', 'c', '!', 'd'}`
   - `"de!f*"` → `{'*', 'e', 'f', '!', 'd'}`
   - `"**!!!****d*****"` → `{'*', '!', 'd'}`

2. **Character Counts**:
   - `'*': 3`, `'!': 3`, `'d': 3`, `'a': 1`, `'b': 1`, `'c': 1`, `'e': 1`, `'f': 1`

3. **Final Characters**:
   - Only `'*'`, `'!'`, and `'d'` have a count of `3` (equal to the number of strings), so they are returned.

---

### Summary
The function effectively finds common characters by leveraging a dictionary to count occurrences and
filtering based on the number of strings. It ensures efficiency by processing only unique characters
in each string and avoids unnecessary space usage by focusing on characters common across all inputs.
